  Create the initial project plan based on the project brief.

  Your goal is to produce **project-level components only**:
  - Project goals, constraints, and success metrics.
  - A list of project-level components (high-level work units).
  - Each component: name, brief description, interfaces to other components.
  - Dependencies and rough execution order.

  Follow these phases:
  1. Clarify project goals, constraints, and non-functional requirements.
  2. Define high-level milestones or phases.
  3. Decompose the project into coherent project-level components (no modules or tasks).
  4. Identify dependencies and rough execution order between components.
  5. Call out key risks at the project level.

  When complete, return the project plan with components only.
  Do NOT break components into modules or tasks—downstream agents will do that.
