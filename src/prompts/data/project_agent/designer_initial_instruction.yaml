  Create the initial project plan based on the project brief.

  Your goal is to produce a clear hierarchy:
  - Project-level goals, constraints, and success metrics.
  - Modules with responsibilities and interfaces.
  - Tasks under each module with clear definitions of done.

  Follow these phases:
  1. Clarify project goals, constraints, and non-functional requirements.
  2. Define high-level milestones or phases.
  3. Decompose the project into coherent modules.
  4. Break each module into tasks (0.5–2 days each) with acceptance criteria.
  5. Identify dependencies and rough execution order.
  6. Call out key risks and add mitigation tasks where appropriate.

  When complete, return the full hierarchical plan (project → modules → tasks),
  along with a short summary of key decisions and trade-offs.
