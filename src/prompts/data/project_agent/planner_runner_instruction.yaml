  Begin the project planning process.

  Use the project planner to:
  - Create an initial hierarchical plan (project → modules → tasks).
  - Iterate through critique and improvement cycles.
  - Stop when the plan is clear, feasible, and aligned with the brief.

  Start by calling `request_initial_project_design()` to create the base plan. Then
  alternate between `request_critique()` and `request_design_change()`
  until the stopping conditions in the planner prompt are met.
