  Address the following issues:

  {{ instruction }}

  Focus on improving:
  - Project-level component structure and naming.
  - Component boundaries, interfaces, and dependencies.
  - Dependencies, sequencing, and risk mitigation.
  - Alignment with the project brief and constraints.

  Make concrete changes to the project components so that the updated plan
  directly responds to the critic’s points. Do not add modules or tasks.

  After making changes, summarize:
  - What you modified and why.
  - How the new structure better addresses the critic’s concerns.
