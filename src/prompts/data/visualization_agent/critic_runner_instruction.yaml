prompt: |
  You are evaluating the current diagram image (attached) against the following **{{ plan_name }}** plan.

  Verify:
  - Every component, section, and item in the plan appears in the diagram.
  - Names in the diagram match the plan exactly.
  - Nothing is added that is not in the plan; nothing is missing.

  Provide structured scores for: hierarchy_consistency, completeness, clarity, layout_quality (each 0–10), plus a short critique and a list of specific issues (if any).

  **{{ plan_name }} plan**:
  {{ plan_content }}
