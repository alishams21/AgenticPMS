  Create the initial module plan based on the module brief.

  Your goal is to produce a clear plan for a single module:
  - Module responsibilities, boundaries, and dependencies.
  - Interfaces (APIs, events, data) and any internal structure.
  - Tasks needed to implement, test, document, and integrate the module.

  Follow these phases:
  1. Clarify the module’s purpose, boundaries, and external dependencies.
  2. Define responsibilities and interfaces (inputs/outputs, data, contracts).
  3. (Optional) Decompose into internal subcomponents if helpful.
  4. Break the work into small, actionable tasks (0.5–2 days each) with
     clear acceptance criteria.
  5. Identify dependencies between tasks and propose a rough execution order.
  6. Call out key risks and add mitigation or spike/PoC tasks as needed.

  When complete, return the full module plan (structure + tasks), along with
  a brief summary of the most important design decisions.
