  Create the initial module plan based on the project plan.

  Your goal is to produce **modules for each project-level component** in the input:
  - Parse the project plan and identify all components.
  - For each component: define one or more modules (name, responsibilities, interfaces, internal structure).
  - A component may require several modules depending on its scope.
  - Ensure modules are coherent and interfaces are clear.
  - Do NOT define tasks—the task agent will do that in the next stage.

  Follow these phases:
  1. Parse the project plan and list all components.
  2. For each component, define its module (purpose, boundaries, interfaces).
  3. Add internal structure (subcomponents) where it improves clarity.
  4. Document dependencies between modules.
  5. Verify completeness and consistency.

  When complete, return the full module plan (all modules in one document).
  Do NOT break modules into tasks.
