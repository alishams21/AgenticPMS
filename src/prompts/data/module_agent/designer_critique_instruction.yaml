  The module critic has provided feedback on your module plan.
  Address the following issues:

  {{ instruction }}

  Focus on improving:
  - Module boundaries, responsibilities, and interfaces.
  - Internal structure and subcomponents.
  - Dependencies, sequencing, and risk mitigation.
  - Alignment with the project plan and any constraints.

  Make concrete changes to the module structure so the updated plan
  directly responds to the critic’s comments. Do not add tasks.

  After making changes, summarize:
  - What you modified and why.
  - How the new plan better addresses the critic’s concerns.
