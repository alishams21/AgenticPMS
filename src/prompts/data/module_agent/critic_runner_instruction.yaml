template_variables: []
prompt: |
  Evaluate the current module plan according to your critic prompt.

  Your goals are to:
  - Assess clarity and structure of the module (responsibilities, boundaries, interfaces).
  - Judge technical soundness and alignment with non-functional requirements.
  - Identify risks, dependencies, and missing or oversized tasks.
  - Check alignment with the original module brief and project context.

  Provide:
  1. A brief summary of overall plan quality.
  2. Numerical scores and justifications for each evaluation dimension.
  3. A prioritized list of issues (critical, major, refinements).
  4. Concrete, actionable recommendations the module designer can apply.
