  Begin the module planning process.

  Use the module planner to:
  - Create an initial plan for this module (structure + tasks).
  - Iterate through critique and improvement cycles.
  - Stop when the plan is clear, feasible, and aligned with the module brief.

  Start by calling `request_initial_design()` to create the base module plan.
  Then alternate between `request_critique()` and `request_design_change()`
  until the stopping conditions in the module planner prompt are met.
