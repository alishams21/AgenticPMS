  Begin the task planning process.

  Use the task planner to:
  - Create an initial task definition (and subtasks if needed).
  - Iterate through critique and improvement cycles.
  - Stop when the task is clear, feasible, and ready for execution.

  Start by calling `request_initial_task_design()` to create the base task plan.
  Then alternate between `request_task_critique()` and `request_task_design_change()`
  until the stopping conditions in the task planner prompt are met.
