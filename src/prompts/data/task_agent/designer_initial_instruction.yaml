  Create the initial task plan based on the module plan.

  Your goal is to define tasks for **each module** in the input:
  - Parse the module plan and identify all modules.
  - For each module: define tasks (0.5–2 days each) with acceptance criteria.
  - Ensure tasks cover implementation, tests, observability, docs, integration.
  - Document dependencies between tasks.

  Follow these phases:
  1. Parse the module plan and list all modules.
  2. For each module, break the work into actionable tasks.
  3. Add acceptance criteria and definitions of done.
  4. Identify dependencies and sequencing.
  5. Verify completeness and consistency.

  When complete, return the full task plan (all tasks grouped by module).
  Each task should be small, clear, and assignable.
