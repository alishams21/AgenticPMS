  Create the initial task plan based on the task brief.

  Your goal is to define a single task that is:
  - Clearly described.
  - Right-sized (a few hours to a few days).
  - Equipped with concrete acceptance criteria and, if useful, subtasks.

  Follow these phases:
  1. Clarify the task’s intent and boundaries (what is in/out of scope).
  2. Write a concise task description that an assignee can quickly understand.
  3. (Optional) Break the work into subtasks when it improves clarity.
  4. Define objective acceptance criteria that make “done” unambiguous.
  5. Identify dependencies and preconditions (e.g., required access, prior work).

  When complete, return the full task definition:
  - Summary.
  - Scope.
  - Subtasks (if any).
  - Acceptance criteria.
  - Dependencies and preconditions.
