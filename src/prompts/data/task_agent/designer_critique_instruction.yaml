  The task critic has provided feedback on your task plan.
  Address the following issues:

  {{ instruction }}

  Focus on improving:
  - Clarity of the task description.
  - Scope and feasibility (size and complexity).
  - Coverage of steps/subtasks.
  - Acceptance criteria (objectivity and testability).
  - Dependencies and preconditions.

  Make concrete changes to the task summary, subtasks, acceptance criteria,
  and dependencies so the updated plan directly responds to the critic’s comments.

  After making changes, summarize:
  - What you modified and why.
  - How the new task definition better addresses the critic’s concerns.
